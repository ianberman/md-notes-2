Before that, I studied at NYU, and (among many other things) spent a semester at IRCAM, where I developed a [style transfer tool](https://github.com/ianberman/In-The-Style-Of...) using their Mubu suite for audio mosaicing and concatanative resynthesis within Max/MSP -- a bit of a precursor to ML tools we have available now.
