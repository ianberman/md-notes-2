#### About
I'm an artist working primarily with sound and computation. I'm particularly interested in realtime generative audio, human-computer interaction, and developing more equitable + sustainable infrastructures for arts and living.

#### Current Projects
- [Despelote](https://despelotegame.com) - upcoming indie game. I'm handling the dialogue and sound design, which emphasizes field recordings taken across Quito, Ecuador.
- [Herndon Dryhurst Studio](https://herndondryhurst.studio/) - audio editing and generative art for the Interdependence podcast + assisting with upcoming multimedia projects

#### Past Work
In New York I primarily worked as a production sound mixer and post sound designer for indie films and commercials. You can find a gear list and some selected past projects [here](./filmsound).
I also studied at NYU and spent a semester at IRCAM, where I developed a [style transfer tool](https://github.com/ianberman/In-The-Style-Of...) using thier Mubu suite for audio mosaicing and concatanative resynthesis within Max/MSP.
