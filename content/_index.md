#### About
I'm an artist working primarily with sound and computation. Particularly interested in realtime generative audio, human-machine interaction, and developing more equitable + sustainable infrastructures for arts and living.

#### Current Projects

- [Herndon Dryhurst Studio](https://herndondryhurst.studio/) - assistance developing upcoming projects using ML audio tools, custom training data, and Holly+. Audio editing and generative art for the Interdependence podcast.
- [Marianna Simnett](https://mariannasimnett.com/) - research and training data preparation for the flute opera [GORGON](https://www.las-art.foundation/programme/gorgon), using real-time audio style transfer and voice modeling software. I also managed [Holly+](https://holly.plus/) voice implementation for the dog character.

Before that, I studied at NYU, and (among many other things) spent a semester at IRCAM, where I developed a [style transfer tool](https://github.com/ianberman/In-The-Style-Of...) using their Mubu suite for audio mosaicing and concatanative resynthesis within Max/MSP -- a bit of a precursor to ML tools we have available now.
