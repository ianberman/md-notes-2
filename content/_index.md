#### About
I'm an artist working primarily with sound and computation. Particularly interested in realtime generative audio, human-machine interaction, and developing more equitable + sustainable infrastructures for arts and living.

#### Current Projects
- [Despelote](https://despelotegame.com) - upcoming video game. I'm handling the dialogue and sound design, which emphasizes field recordings taken across Quito, Ecuador.
- [Herndon Dryhurst Studio](https://herndondryhurst.studio/) - assistance developing upcoming projects using ML tools, custom training data, and Holly+. Audio editing and generative art for the Interdependence podcast.
- [Marianna Simnett](https://mariannasimnett.com/) - research and training data preparation for an upcoming performance using real-time audio style transfer and voice modeling software. 

#### Past Work
From 2020-2022, I primarily worked as a production sound mixer and post sound designer for indie films and commercials in New York City. Two of them recently premiered at Cannes: [The Sweet East](https://www.quinzaine-cineastes.fr/en/film/the-sweet-east) and [Lemon Tree](https://www.quinzaine-cineastes.fr/en/film/lemon-tree).

You can find a gear list and some older film+commercial projects [here](./filmsound).

Before that, I studied at NYU, and (among many other things) spent a semester at IRCAM, where I developed a [style transfer tool](https://github.com/ianberman/In-The-Style-Of...) using their Mubu suite for audio mosaicing and concatanative resynthesis within Max/MSP -- a bit of a precursor to ML tools we have available now.
